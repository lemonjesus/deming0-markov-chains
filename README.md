# Deming 0 Markov Chains

Our Archive Bot archives all messages in public channels. Using Markov chains, you can create sentences from this data
based on the probability of one chunk of words to the next. This is basically how Subreddit Simulator works except
it has less data to work with so it's not as good.

## To Run

Clone the git repo, run `npm install`, and then `nodejs index.js`.

## Where do I get the data?

The data from Archive Bot is accessable via FTP on *the_plex*.
